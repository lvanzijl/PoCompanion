## Dashboard

### Use Case: Product Overview Hub

**What It Is:**  
The Dashboard is your central command center. It provides an at-a-glance view of the health and status of your selected product, showing key performance indicators that matter most to Product Owners.

**Why It Matters:**  
As a Product Owner managing multiple products, you need quick visibility into each product's health without diving into detailed reports. The Dashboard aggregates critical metrics so you can identify issues early and make informed decisions quickly.

**Sub-Features:**
- Profile selection dropdown for switching between products
- Key metrics cards (velocity, backlog health, capacity)
- Quick links to detailed analytics
- Real-time sync status
- Recent activity feed
- Team performance summary

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Monday Morning Check-In**

Sarah starts her Monday by checking both products:

1. **Morning Review for Product A (Mobile App)**
   - Opens PO Companion
   - Sees Dashboard showing Team Alpha's metrics
   - Notices velocity dropped 15% last sprint - needs investigation
   - Backlog health score is 87% - acceptable but trending down
   - Sees 3 epics are at risk based on forecast

2. **Switch to Product B (Web Portal)**
   - Switches profile to Product B in dropdown
   - Dashboard refreshes with Team Beta's data
   - Velocity is stable at 42 points/sprint
   - Backlog health is excellent at 94%
   - One critical dependency blocking 2 features

3. **Prioritize Her Day**
   - Team Alpha needs attention due to velocity drop
   - Schedule conversation with Team Beta about blocked dependency
   - Check detailed reports after standup

### How To Use the Dashboard

## Profiles Management

### Use Case: Multi-Product Configuration

**What It Is:**  
Profiles allow you to define different views of your Azure DevOps data. Each profile represents a specific combination of products, teams, and area paths that you want to track separately.

**Why It Matters:**  
Product Owners often manage multiple products with different teams, backlogs, and metrics. Profiles let you segment your data so metrics are accurate and relevant to each context. Without profiles, velocity and health metrics would be mixed across all your work, making them meaningless.

**Sub-Features:**
- Create multiple profiles
- Configure area paths per profile
- Set default profile
- Profile-specific filters
- Quick profile switching
- Profile import/export
- Archive unused profiles

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Quarterly Planning Preparation**

Sarah needs to prepare quarterly plans for both products:

1. **Review Current Profiles**
   - Has "Product A - Mobile App" profile tracking:
     - Area Path: `Project\Mobile\Team Alpha`
     - Focus: User authentication and payment features
   - Has "Product B - Web Portal" profile tracking:
     - Area Path: `Project\Web\Team Beta`
     - Focus: Admin dashboard and reporting

2. **Create New Profile for Combined View**
   - Creates "Q1 All Products" profile
   - Selects both area paths
   - Uses this for executive reporting
   - Keeps original profiles for day-to-day work

3. **Configure Profile Settings**
   - Sets "Product A" as default (opens on startup)
   - Archives old profile from previous year
   - Exports profile configuration as backup

### How To Use Profiles

**Navigation:**
- **Page Location:** `/profiles`
- **Menu:** Click "Profiles" in main navigation
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** `Ctrl+P`

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **View Existing Profiles**
   ```
   Profiles page shows:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Profile Name         │ Area Paths      │ Actions       │
   │─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────│
   │ Product A - Mobile   │ Project\Mobile  │ [Edit] [Del]  │
   │ Product B - Web      │ Project\Web     │ [Edit] [Del]  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

2. **Create a New Profile**
   - Click "Add Profile" button (top right)

2. **Create PAT in Azure DevOps**
   - Opens Azure DevOps → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   - Clicks "New Token"
   - Configures:
     - Name: "PO Companion - Read Access"
     - Expiration: 90 days (company policy)
     - Scopes: "Work Items (Read)", "Code (Read)", "Build (Read)"
   - Copies token immediately (won't be shown again)

3. **Configure in PO Companion**
   - Pastes token into PAT field
   - Clicks "Test Connection"
   - Sees success message

**Why It Matters:**  
As a Product Owner, you need to see the big picture (strategic goals) and the details (individual tasks) simultaneously. The tree view lets you understand dependencies, spot validation issues, track progress at every level, and maintain backlog quality. It's your single source of truth for all work items.

**Sub-Features:**
- Hierarchical tree grid view
- Multi-level filtering (product, team, iteration, state)
- Real-time validation with visual indicators
- Column picker for customization
- Work item detail panel
- Bulk operations (multi-select)
- Search and text highlighting

## Backlog Health

### Use Case: Data Quality Monitoring

**What It Is:**  
Backlog Health is your data quality dashboard. It monitors your backlog across iterations, identifying validation issues that could impact planning accuracy. It tracks trends over time, helping you maintain a healthy, well-defined backlog that supports reliable forecasting and sprint planning.

**Why It Matters:**  
Garbage in, garbage out. If your work items lack effort estimates, have broken parent-child links, or miss acceptance criteria, your velocity metrics become meaningless and planning becomes guesswork. Backlog Health helps you proactively find and fix these issues before they cause problems in sprint planning.

**Sub-Features:**
- Health score calculation (% of items without validation issues)
- Trend visualization (health over time)
- Issue breakdown by type
- Iteration-by-iteration health table
- Drill-down to specific problematic work items
- Validation rule configuration
- Exportable health reports
- Team comparison views

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Weekly Backlog Maintenance**

Every Wednesday, Sarah reviews backlog health for both products:

1. **Product A Health Check**
   - Opens Backlog Health page
   - Selects "Product A - Mobile App" profile
   - Current health: 87% (down from 92% last week)
   - Trend chart shows decline over past 3 sprints

2. **Identify Problem Areas**
   - Issue breakdown shows:
     - 15 PBIs missing effort estimates (most common issue)
     - 8 PBIs with no acceptance criteria
     - 3 orphaned PBIs (no parent feature)
     - 2 tasks with no assigned team member
   - Total: 28 issues affecting 23 work items

3. **Drill into Specific Issues**
   - Clicks "15 PBIs missing effort" 
   - List shows which PBIs need estimates
   - Notices they're all in "Two-Factor Auth" feature (new work)
   - Makes note: Schedule estimation session with team

4. **Compare Iterations**
   - Iteration health table shows:
     - Sprint 13: 94% (excellent)
     - Sprint 14: 89% (good)
     - Sprint 15: 87% (declining - needs attention)
   - Pattern: Health drops when new work added, improves after grooming

5. **Set Weekly Goal**
   - Target: Get back to 95% health
   - Plan: 
     - Monday: Team estimation for Two-Factor Auth PBIs
     - Tuesday: Add acceptance criteria to 8 PBIs
     - Wednesday: Link orphaned PBIs to correct features

6. **Product B Quick Check**
   - Switches to Product B profile
   - Health: 94% (stable, excellent)
   - Only 6 minor issues
   - No action needed this week

## Effort Distribution

### Use Case: Capacity Planning Heat Map

**What It Is:**  
Effort Distribution is a visual heat map showing how work effort is distributed across your teams (area paths) and time (iterations). It helps you identify over-allocated or under-utilized teams, spot capacity issues before they become problems, and ensure sustainable work distribution.

**Why It Matters:**  
Product Owners need to balance work across teams to prevent burnout and ensure consistent delivery. This heat map makes capacity problems immediately visible. Teams at 100%+ capacity will likely miss commitments; teams at 50% may not be challenged enough. The sweet spot is 75-85% capacity utilization.

**Sub-Features:**
- Heat map visualization (area paths × iterations)
- Capacity vs. effort comparison
- Over/under-allocation highlighting
- Drill-down to specific cells
- Team capacity configuration
- Iteration planning view
- Load balancing recommendations
- Historical utilization tracking

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Quarterly Capacity Planning**

Sarah plans Q2 work distribution for both products:

1. **View Overall Distribution**
   - Opens Effort Distribution page
   - Heat map shows:
     ```
     Team/Sprint  │ S14  │ S15  │ S16  │ S17  │ S18  │
     ─────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
     Team Alpha   │ 🟢42 │ 🔴56 │ 🟡48 │ 🟢40 │ 🟢38 │
     Team Beta    │ 🟢35 │ 🟢38 │ 🟢42 │ 🟡52 │ 🟢45 │
     ```
     Key: 🟢 Good (75-85%), 🟡 High (86-95%), 🔴 Over (>95%)

2. **Identify Problem: Team Alpha Sprint 15**
   - Team Alpha Sprint 15 shows red (56 points planned)
   - Team capacity: 45 points
   - 124% utilization - over-allocated by 11 points
   - Risk: Team will likely miss commitment

3. **Drill Down to Details**
   - Clicks red cell (Team Alpha, S15)
   - Shows work items:
     - Epic: Two-Factor Auth (18 pts)
     - Epic: Payment Integration (22 pts)
     - Epic: Profile Management (16 pts)
     - Total: 56 pts planned, 45 pts capacity

4. **Rebalance Load**
   - Options:
     1. Move "Profile Management" (16 pts) to Sprint 16
     2. Split "Payment Integration" across S15 and S16
     3. Request Team Beta help with 11 points of work
   - Decision: Move Profile Management to S16
   - Updated map now shows:
     - S15: 40 pts (89% - acceptable)
     - S16: 64 pts (142% - now over!)

5. **Iterate to Balance**
   - Further adjusts S16 workload
   - Final distribution:
     - S15: 40 pts (89%) ✓
     - S16: 48 pts (107%) - slightly over but manageable
     - S17: 40 pts (89%) ✓

6. **Compare Product B**
   - Team Beta shows balanced load
   - All sprints 80-90% capacity
   - No action needed

   ```

**Tips:**
- Target 75-85% capacity utilization (sustainable pace)
- Update capacity for holidays, vacations, training
- Review heat map during quarterly planning
- Over 100%? Move work, don't add capacity
- Under 75%? Pull work forward or add scope
- Consider team dependencies when balancing
- Buffer 10-15% for unplanned work, bugs
- Use historical data to calibrate estimates

**Planning Workflow:**

**Quarterly Planning:**
1. Set team capacities for next 6 sprints
2. Rough-assign epics to sprints
3. Review heat map for red/yellow cells
4. Rebalance to target 75-85% utilization
5. Validate dependencies don't block
6. Export plan for stakeholder review
7. Refine sprint-by-sprint during planning meetings

**Sprint Planning:**
1. Check current sprint capacity
2. Confirm utilization is 75-85%
3. If over: move lowest priority items out
4. If under: pull additional ready items in
5. Final check before sprint starts

## Velocity Dashboard

### Use Case: Team Performance and Sprint Planning

**What It Is:**  
The Velocity Dashboard tracks your team's completed story points per sprint. It shows historical velocity trends, calculates averages, and provides forecasting data to help you plan future sprints realistically based on actual team performance.

**Why It Matters:**  
Velocity is the foundation of data-driven sprint planning. By tracking how much work your team actually completes sprint-over-sprint, you can make reliable commitments instead of guesses. It helps you predict when features will complete, identify capacity issues, and set realistic expectations with stakeholders.

**Sub-Features:**
- Sprint-by-sprint velocity chart
- Rolling averages (3-sprint, 6-sprint)
- Velocity trends (increasing, stable, decreasing)
- Capacity vs. actual comparison
- Team velocity comparison
- Forecasting based on velocity
- Anomaly detection (outlier sprints)
- Export for reporting

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Sprint Planning for Both Teams**

Sarah prepares for sprint planning sessions:

1. **Review Team Alpha Velocity (Product A)**
   - Opens Velocity Dashboard
   - Selects "Team Alpha" profile
   - Last 6 sprints velocity:
     - S10: 38 pts, S11: 42 pts, S12: 40 pts
     - S13: 45 pts, S14: 38 pts, S15: 41 pts
   - 3-sprint average: 41 points
   - Trend: Stable (good predictability)

2. **Plan Sprint 16 for Team Alpha**
   - 3-sprint avg: 41 pts (most reliable)
   - 6-sprint avg: 41 pts (confirms consistency)
   - Planning decision: Commit to 40 pts (10% buffer)
   - Rationale: One team member on vacation next sprint

3. **Review Team Beta Velocity (Product B)**
   - Switches to "Team Beta" profile
   - Last 6 sprints:
     - S10: 50 pts, S11: 52 pts, S12: 28 pts (outlier!)
     - S13: 51 pts, S14: 49 pts, S15: 50 pts
   - 3-sprint average: 50 points
   - Anomaly detected: Sprint 12 (28 pts)

4. **Investigate Anomaly**
   - Clicks Sprint 12 bar
   - Detail shows: Major production issue consumed 3 days
   - Note: Team handled unplanned work, not a velocity problem
   - Excludes S12 from planning calculations

5. **Plan Sprint 16 for Team Beta**
   - Adjusted 3-sprint avg (excluding S12): 50 pts
   - No vacation or holidays
   - Planning decision: Commit to 48 pts
   - Pull 2 pts from backlog if team finishes early

6. **Forecast Epic Completion**
   - "Two-Factor Auth Epic" = 48 pts remaining
   - Team Alpha velocity: 41 pts/sprint
   - Forecast: 2 sprints to complete (S16-S17)
   - Communicates to stakeholders: End of S17

8. **Identify Anomalies**
   ```
   Sprints marked with 🔴 are anomalies
   ```
   - System detects outliers (>2 standard deviations from average)
   - Hover over red marker to see why flagged
   - Click to add notes explaining anomaly
   - Option to exclude from calculations

9. **Export Velocity Data**
   ```
   [📊 Export] button → Options:
   
   - Velocity Chart (image)
   - Sprint Data (Excel)
   - Planning Report (PDF)
   - Forecast Report
   ```

**Tips:**
- Use 3-sprint average for near-term planning
- Use 6-sprint average for long-term trends
- Don't plan at 100% of velocity - leave 10-15% buffer
- Investigate anomalies - don't ignore them
- Velocity should trend toward stable, not always increasing
- If velocity drops consistently, investigate (not necessarily bad)
- New team? Need 3+ sprints for reliable velocity
- Team changes? Recalibrate velocity expectations
- Story point scale changes? Reset velocity baseline

**Velocity Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Comparing team velocities (different scales)
- ❌ Using velocity as performance metric (encourages gaming)
- ❌ Pushing team to increase velocity every sprint
- ❌ Planning at exactly 100% of velocity (no buffer)
- ❌ Ignoring anomalies instead of investigating
- ❌ Using velocity from first 1-2 sprints (not stable yet)

**Good Velocity Patterns:**
- ✓ Stable velocity over time (predictability)
- ✓ Low standard deviation (consistency)
- ✓ Planning at 80-90% of velocity (sustainable)
- ✓ Understanding and documenting anomalies
- ✓ Using velocity for team's own planning only

## Epic Forecast

### Use Case: Feature Completion Prediction

**What It Is:**  
Epic Forecast predicts when an Epic or Feature will complete based on team velocity and remaining work. It provides best-case, likely, and worst-case completion dates, helping you set realistic expectations with stakeholders and make informed trade-off decisions.

**Why It Matters:**  
Stakeholders constantly ask "When will feature X be done?" Epic Forecast gives you data-driven answers instead of guesses. It factors in team velocity variability, scope changes, and capacity to provide ranges that account for uncertainty. This helps you manage expectations and make go/no-go decisions on features.

**Sub-Features:**
- Epic/Feature selection
- Remaining work calculation
- Multi-scenario forecasting (best/likely/worst)
- Confidence intervals
- Velocity-based timeline
- Scope change impact analysis
- Dependency consideration
- Forecast accuracy tracking

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Stakeholder Meeting - Feature Commitment**

Sarah needs to commit to feature delivery dates:

1. **Executive Asks: "When will Two-Factor Auth be ready?"**
   - Opens Epic Forecast page
   - Selects Epic: "Two-Factor Authentication"
   - System shows:
     - Total effort: 48 points
     - Completed: 12 points
     - Remaining: 36 points

2. **Review Team Velocity**
   - Team Alpha velocity: 41 pts/sprint (3-sprint avg)
   - Variability: ±5 points (low, good predictability)
   - Current sprint: 15 (Feature starts Sprint 16)

3. **View Forecast Results**
   - Best case: End of Sprint 16 (2 weeks)
     - If velocity = 46 pts (high)
     - Assumes no scope changes
   - Likely: End of Sprint 17 (4 weeks)
     - If velocity = 41 pts (average)
     - Most probable outcome: 75% confidence
   - Worst case: End of Sprint 18 (6 weeks)
     - If velocity = 36 pts (low)
     - If minor scope additions
     - Conservative estimate: 95% confidence

4. **Consider Dependencies**
   - Checks dependency graph
   - 2 PBIs depend on "User Profile API" (different epic)
   - User Profile API completes Sprint 16
   - No blocking dependencies after S16

5. **Make Commitment**
   - Tells executive: "Most likely end of Sprint 17 (4 weeks)"
   - Explains: "75% confident, assumes stable velocity"
   - Conservative: "Could slip to Sprint 18 if scope grows"
   - Documents commitment in forecast tool

6. **Track Forecast Accuracy**
   - After Sprint 16: 19 points completed (below avg)
   - Remaining: 17 points (was 36, now 17)
   - Forecast updates:
     - Likely: Still Sprint 17 (17 pts < 41 pt capacity)
     - High confidence: 90%
   - On track for commitment!

9. **Save and Track Forecast**
   ```
   [💾 Save Forecast] button
   
   - Saves current forecast
   - Creates baseline for accuracy tracking
   - Can compare actual vs. forecast later
   - Useful for retrospectives and calibration
   ```

10. **Update Forecast**
    ```
    Click [🔄 Refresh Forecast] button
    
    - Recalculates based on latest data
    - Updates velocity if new sprints completed
    - Adjusts remaining work if items completed
    - Shows what changed since last forecast
    ```

11. **Export Forecast**
    ```
    [📊 Export] → Options:
    
    - Executive Summary (PDF) - One page overview
    - Detailed Report (PDF) - Includes assumptions, risks
    - Timeline (Image) - Visual for presentations
    - Data (Excel) - Raw numbers for analysis
    ```

**Tips:**
- Update forecast weekly (after standups or sprint planning)
- Always communicate likely case, mention worst case
- Document assumptions when saving forecast
- Don't hide worst-case scenarios from stakeholders
- Track forecast accuracy to improve future predictions
- If forecast slips repeatedly, investigate root causes
- Frozen scope = higher accuracy
- New team? Forecasts less reliable until velocity stabilizes

**Using Forecasts in Conversations:**

**Good Example:**
> "Based on Team Alpha's velocity of 41 points per sprint, we'll most likely complete Two-Factor Auth by end of Sprint 17 (Sep 29). There's a 75% chance we hit this date. Worst case, if velocity drops or scope grows, we could slip to Sprint 18 (Oct 13), but that's only 5% likely."

**Bad Example:**
> "We'll be done in 2 weeks." (No confidence interval, unrealistic best-case)

**When Forecast Changes:**
> "Our forecast has shifted. Originally Sprint 17, now looking like Sprint 18. Reason: Scope increased by 12 points when we discovered additional security requirements. Updated likely date: Oct 13."

## State Timeline Analysis

### Use Case: Work Item Lifecycle Optimization

**What It Is:**  
State Timeline Analysis visualizes how work items move through different states (New → Approved → Committed → In Progress → Done). It tracks time spent in each state, identifies bottlenecks, and compares individual work items against team averages to optimize your workflow.

**Why It Matters:**  
Understanding where work items get stuck helps you improve process efficiency. If PBIs sit "In Progress" for weeks, you might have too much WIP or hidden blockers. If items spend days in "Approved" before starting, your grooming-to-sprint handoff needs work. This analysis helps you spot and fix these issues.

**Sub-Features:**
- Visual state transition timeline
- Time-in-state calculations
- Cycle time vs. lead time metrics
- Bottleneck identification
- Team average comparisons
- State transition analysis (which paths items take)
- Aging work item alerts
- Process efficiency metrics

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Daily Standup - Stuck Work Item Investigation**

During standup, team mentions PBI is "stuck":

1. **Team Reports Issue**
   - "PBI 12345: SMS Integration has been In Progress for 8 days"
   - Sarah opens State Timeline page
   - Enters work item ID: 12345

2. **View Timeline**
   - PBI lifecycle visualization shows:
     - New: 2 days (Jan 5-7)
     - Approved: 5 days (Jan 7-12) ⚠ Longer than average
     - Committed: 1 day (Jan 12-13)
     - In Progress: 8 days (Jan 13-21) ⚠ Much longer than average
     - (Not yet Done)
   - Total cycle time so far: 16 days

3. **Compare to Team Average**
   - Team average for PBIs:
     - In Progress: 3 days typically
     - Total cycle time: 7 days average
   - This PBI: 2x longer than normal
   - Red flag: Needs attention

4. **Analyze State Transitions**
   - Check transition history:
     - Jan 13: New → In Progress (skipped Approved/Committed!)
     - Jan 15: In Progress → Blocked (2 days)
     - Jan 16: Blocked → In Progress (1 day)
     - Jan 18: In Progress → Blocked (2 days)
     - Jan 19: Blocked → In Progress (ongoing)
   - Pattern: Multiple block/unblock cycles

5. **Root Cause Discussion**
   - Team discusses: External API vendor issues
   - Blocking issues not visible in standard view
   - Decision: Move to "Waiting" state for external dependencies
   - Process improvement: Add "Waiting on External" state

6. **Take Action**
   - Update process to use "Waiting" state
   - Document in State Timeline for future reference
   - Create alert: PBIs in "In Progress" > 5 days

10. **Export Timeline**
    ```
    [📊 Export] → Options:
    
    - Timeline Image (PNG) - Visual for presentations
    - State Report (PDF) - Detailed analysis
    - Data (Excel) - Raw state history
    - Comparison (Excel) - Item vs. team averages
    ```

**Tips:**
- Review aging report weekly
- Set alerts for items "In Progress" > 5 days
- Use cycle time to improve sprint planning accuracy
- Compare similar work items to identify patterns
- High efficiency (>80%) = good process flow
- Low efficiency (<50%) = too much waiting time
- Blocked state should be explicit (don't hide in "In Progress")
- Use state timeline in retrospectives to identify improvements

**Process Improvement Workflow:**

**Monthly Review:**
1. Run aging items report
2. Analyze bottleneck patterns
3. Calculate average cycle time by work item type
4. Identify states where items spend most time
5. Discuss in retrospective
6. Implement one improvement
7. Measure impact next month

**Common Bottlenecks and Fixes:**
- **Long time in "Approved":** Improve grooming/sprint planning handoff
- **Long time in "In Progress":** Reduce WIP limits, smaller stories
- **Frequent "Blocked":** Better dependency management, unblock process
- **Long cycle time:** Break down work items, reduce scope per item

## Dependency Graph

### Use Case: Dependency Visualization

**What It Is:**  
The Dependency Graph visualizes relationships between work items, showing parent-child hierarchies, predecessor-successor links, and related items. It helps you understand the web of dependencies, identify critical paths, and spot blocking relationships that could delay delivery.

**Why It Matters:**  
Modern software projects have complex dependencies. Feature A can't start until Feature B completes. Epic X depends on infrastructure from Epic Y. Without visualization, these dependencies are invisible until they cause problems. The Dependency Graph makes dependencies explicit, helping you plan more effectively and avoid surprises.

**Sub-Features:**
- Interactive node-link graph
- Multiple relationship types (parent-child, predecessor-successor, related)
- Critical path highlighting
- Blocking relationship identification
- Zoom and pan navigation
- Filter by relationship type
- Dependency chain analysis
- Export graph images

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Release Planning - Dependency Management**

Sarah plans Q2 release across both products:

1. **Visualize Product A Dependencies**
   - Opens Dependency Graph
   - Filters to Product A epics
   - Graph shows 5 epics, 12 features, 45 PBIs
   - Complex web of dependencies visible

2. **Identify Critical Path**
   - Highlights critical path (longest dependency chain)
   - Critical path: Epic "User Auth" → Epic "Payment" → Epic "Checkout"
   - These must complete in sequence
   - Any delay in Auth delays entire release

3. **Spot Blocking Dependencies**
   - Epic "Admin Dashboard" has red link to "User Auth"
   - Meaning: Admin Dashboard can't start until User Auth completes
   - User Auth currently Sprint 16-17
   - Admin Dashboard can't start before Sprint 18

4. **Analyze Cross-Product Dependencies**
   - Switches to "All Products" view
   - Discovers: Product B's "Shared Components" epic blocks Product A
   - This dependency wasn't in sprint plans!
   - Team Beta must prioritize Shared Components

5. **Replan Based on Dependencies**
   - Moves "Admin Dashboard" from Sprint 17 to Sprint 18
   - Adds "Shared Components" to Team Beta's Sprint 15
   - Updates stakeholder timeline: Delivery shifts 2 weeks

6. **Document Dependencies**
   - Exports graph as image for release plan documentation
   - Shares with both teams
   - Adds dependency notes in Azure DevOps

### How To Use Dependency Graph

    - Data (Excel) - Dependency matrix
    - DOT Format - For external graph tools

    ```

**Tips:**
- Review dependency graph during quarterly planning
- Update dependencies when planning new features
- Check critical path before making schedule commitments
- Use graph in cross-team planning meetings
- Color-code teams to see cross-team dependencies
- Export graph for release documentation
- Don't create circular dependencies (tool will warn)
- Keep dependency links up to date (stale links mislead)

**Dependency Management Best Practices:**

**Do:**
- ✓ Document dependencies early (during epic creation)
- ✓ Review dependencies in refinement
- ✓ Plan work to minimize dependencies
- ✓ Work on critical path items first
- ✓ Communicate dependencies across teams
- ✓ Update graph when dependencies change

**Don't:**
- ✗ Ignore dependencies until sprint planning
- ✗ Create circular dependencies (A blocks B blocks A)
- ✗ Over-depend (every item depends on everything)
- ✗ Hide dependencies (makes planning impossible)
- ✗ Assume dependencies will "work out"

**Common Dependency Patterns:**

1. **Sequential (A → B → C):** 
   - Clear order, easy to plan
   - Risk: Any delay cascades

2. **Fan-out (A → B, A → C, A → D):**
   - One item blocks many
   - Risk: A is critical bottleneck

3. **Fan-in (A → C, B → C):**
   - Many items must complete before C
   - Risk: Coordination required

4. **Diamond (A → B, A → C, B → D, C → D):**
   - Complex coordination
   - Risk: High probability of delays

## PR Insights

### Use Case: Code Review Process Optimization

**What It Is:**  
PR Insights analyzes your pull request metrics from the last 6 months, tracking time open, iteration counts, file changes, and linking PRs to work items. It helps you optimize the code review process, identify bottlenecks, and ensure PRs are efficiently merged.

**Why It Matters:**  
Long-lived PRs create integration problems, slow feature delivery, and frustrate developers. By tracking PR metrics, you can identify patterns: Are PRs too large? Do certain developers' PRs languish? Is the review process efficient? This data helps you improve team collaboration and delivery speed.

**Sub-Features:**
- PR metrics dashboard (last 6 months)
- Time-to-merge tracking
- Iteration count analysis
- File change size metrics
- Work item linking (via AB#[ID] convention)
- Reviewer response time
- PR age alerts
- Team comparison views

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Retrospective - Improving Code Review Process**

During sprint retrospective, team discusses slow PR merges:

1. **Review PR Metrics**
   - Opens PR Insights page
   - Last sprint stats:
     - Average time to merge: 4.5 days
     - Average iterations: 3.2 (reviews + changes)
     - 8 PRs merged, 3 still open

2. **Identify Problem Pattern**
   - Sorts PRs by "time open"
   - Top 3 PRs open for 8+ days:
     - PR #245: Authentication refactor (12 files, 8 days)
     - PR #242: Payment integration (18 files, 9 days)
     - PR #238: Database migration (25 files, 11 days)
   - Pattern: Large PRs (>10 files) take 2x longer

3. **Analyze Iteration Counts**
   - PRs with 4+ review iterations take longest
   - Root cause discussion:
     - Large PRs hard to review thoroughly
     - Reviewers overwhelmed by size
     - Multiple rounds of feedback

4. **Team Decision**
   - New team agreement: Max 5 files per PR
   - Break large features into smaller PRs
   - Target: <3 days time-to-merge
   - Target: <2 review iterations

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Adds PR Insights to weekly standup agenda
   - Track trend over next month
   - Measure if agreement improves metrics

6. **Link PRs to Work Items**
   - Reviews which PRs lack work item links
   - Reminds team: Use "AB#12345" in PR descriptions
   - Ensures PRs traceable to features/bugs

   - PR List (Excel) - All PRs with details
   - Team Report (PDF) - By-author metrics
   - Trends (Image) - Charts for presentations
   ```

**Tips:**
- Review PR metrics weekly
- Target <3 days average time-to-merge
- Keep PRs small (<10 files ideal)
- Link all PRs to work items using "AB#[WorkItemId]"
- <2 review iterations indicates good quality
- Discuss PR patterns in retrospectives
- Don't use metrics to evaluate individuals
- Focus on process improvement, not blame

**PR Best Practices:**

**Good PR Habits:**
- ✓ Small, focused changes (one feature/fix)
- ✓ Clear description with "AB#[ID]" link
- ✓ Self-review before requesting review
- ✓ Request 1-2 specific reviewers
- ✓ Respond to feedback promptly

**PR Anti-Patterns:**
- ✗ Large PRs (>15 files) - hard to review
- ✗ Multiple unrelated changes in one PR
- ✗ No description or context
- ✗ No work item link
- ✗ Ignoring reviewer feedback

## Pipeline Insights

### Use Case: CI/CD Health Monitoring

**What It Is:**  
Pipeline Insights monitors your build and release pipeline health metrics, including success rates, build durations, and failing pipelines. It helps you maintain reliable CI/CD, identify flaky tests or infrastructure issues, and improve build performance.

**Why It Matters:**  
Broken pipelines block feature delivery. Long build times slow iteration speed. Flaky tests erode confidence. Pipeline Insights gives you visibility into CI/CD health, helping you prioritize fixes and maintain fast, reliable deployments that support continuous delivery.

**Sub-Features:**
- Build success rate tracking
- Build duration trends
- Failing pipeline identification
- Flaky test detection
- Pipeline performance metrics
- Historical trend analysis
- Alert configuration
- Team pipeline comparison

### Day-to-Day Usage Scenario

**Scenario: Monday Morning CI/CD Health Check**

Sarah checks pipeline health at start of week:

1. **Dashboard Review**
   - Opens Pipeline Insights
   - Overall success rate: 87% (down from 93% last week)
   - Red flag: Something changed

2. **Identify Failing Pipelines**
   - 3 pipelines failing consistently:
     - "Product A - Main Build": 12 failures in 20 runs (60%)
     - "Product B - Integration Tests": 3 failures in 15 runs (80%)
     - "Deployment - Staging": 5 failures in 10 runs (50%)

3. **Investigate Main Build Failures**
   - Clicks "Product A - Main Build"
   - Failure pattern: Started Jan 17
   - Error: "npm install timeout"
   - 10 builds affected
   - Root cause: New dependency added, large size

4. **Investigate Integration Test Failures**
   - Clicks "Product B - Integration Tests"
   - Flaky test detected: "Login_Successful_Test"
   - Passes some runs, fails others (intermittent)
   - Root cause: Race condition in test

5. **Take Action**
   - Product A: Update dependency to smaller alternative
   - Product B: Quarantine flaky test, assign developer to fix
   - Staging deploy: Infrastructure issue, escalate to DevOps

6. **Set Up Alerts**
   - Configures alert: Success rate < 85%
   - Email notification to team
   - Prevents pipeline degradation

    ```

**Tips:**
- Check pipeline health Monday morning
- Target >95% success rate
- Fix failing pipelines immediately
- Quarantine flaky tests until fixed
- Optimize slow builds (target <10 min)
- Set up alerts for degradation
- Track duration trends - builds often slow over time
- Investigate sudden success rate drops
- Keep build agents healthy and updated

**Pipeline Health Best Practices:**

**Healthy CI/CD:**
- ✓ >95% success rate
- ✓ <10 minute build times
- ✓ No flaky tests (100% or 0%)
- ✓ Fast feedback (<5 min for unit tests)
- ✓ Automated rollback on failure

**Pipeline Anti-Patterns:**
- ✗ Ignoring failing builds
- ✗ Accepting flaky tests as "normal"
- ✗ Slow builds (>20 min) that block developers
- ✗ Manual intervention required
- ✗ No monitoring or alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### Problem: "Cannot connect to Azure DevOps"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check URL format:**
   - Must be: `https://dev.azure.com/yourorg` (Azure DevOps)
   - Or: `https://tfs.company.com/tfs/collection` (TFS on-premise)
   - No trailing slash

2. **Verify PAT:**
   - PAT must have "Work Items (Read)" scope
   - Check expiration date in Azure DevOps
   - Generate new PAT if expired

3. **Test network:**
   - Can you access Azure DevOps in browser?
   - Check firewall/proxy settings
   - Try from different network

4. **Check project name:**
   - Case-sensitive!
   - Must match exactly as shown in Azure DevOps

#### Problem: "PAT expired" or "Unauthorized"

**Solutions:**
1. Generate new PAT in Azure DevOps
2. Update in TFS Config page
3. Test connection
4. If still fails, check PAT scopes

### Data Sync Issues

#### Problem: "Sync taking too long" or "Sync stuck"

**Solutions:**
1. **Large backlog:**
   - First sync can take 10-15 minutes for 1000+ items
   - Be patient, let it complete
   - Subsequent syncs faster (incremental)

2. **Cancel and retry:**
   - Click "Cancel Sync"
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Try again

3. **Check Azure DevOps status:**
   - Visit Azure DevOps
   - Check if service is running normally
   - Check service status page

#### Problem: "Data not updating" or "Stale data"

**Solutions:**
1. Manual sync:
   - Click "Sync" button in Work Items page
   - Or press `Ctrl+R`

2. Check last sync time:
   - Shown in Dashboard header
   - If >24 hours, sync recommended

3. Clear cache:
   - Settings → Advanced → "Clear Cache"
   - Then sync again

### Work Item Issues

#### Problem: "Work items not showing" or "Empty tree"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check filters:**
   - Profile selected?
   - Area path correct?
   - Iteration filter not too narrow?
   - State filter not hiding items?

2. **Clear filters:**
   - Click "Reset Filters" button
   - Should show all items

3. **Sync data:**
   - May need fresh sync from Azure DevOps
   - Click "Sync" button

#### Problem: "Validation warnings everywhere"

**Explanation:** This is often normal for new backlogs!

**Solutions:**
1. **Prioritize fixes:**
   - Fix errors (❌) before warnings (⚠)
   - Start with missing effort estimates
   - Then acceptance criteria
